# Inspiration
We decided to code this app as a simple but elegant solution for music lovers who are looking for a specific sound but want to spend less time sifting through suggestions and more time tuning in. We chose a vintage inspired theme that still had a modern feel.

# How It Works
This app allows users to explore new music and artists with a simple search and click. Users can type their favorite artist's name into a simple search bar, click the search button, and five similar artist will dynamically render in separate vintage styled file folder cards. Clicking the top of label on each will open the folder to reveal a description about the artist as well as six corresponding YouTube music videos.

# Technologies We Used
- Bootstrap
- jQuery
- JavaScript
- Moment.js
- LastFM API
- YouTube API
